After successfully configuring git and GitHub, I learned how to create and modify files locally using the git bash. Moreover, I learned how to commit and write a descriptive message pertaining to changes that were recently made to a file. Furthermore, I learned how to "push" modified files and their commit messages to GitHub.



What was most frustrating for me was using the windows 11 terminal to write the commands. I learned that the git bash terminal is where the commands should be executed.



I think that developers use git because it helps with creating an organized development environment. 



This may help with larger projects in the future by providing me with a way to methodically document changes that I make to project files.
